 * <P>
 * <b>This package has been deprecated</b>, and is no longer being enhanced.
 * Users are advised to use packages <tt>com.ibm.as400.access</tt> and
 * <tt>com.ibm.as400.access.list</tt> instead.
 * </P>
 *
 * <P>
 * These classes use buffering, transaction control, and list manipulation to
 * improve the performance and manageability of lists of resources on the
 * system.
 * </P>
 *
 * <P>
 * Some of the components in the com.ibm.as400.access package have counterparts
 * that are represented as resources. For example, RJobList is the
 * com.ibm.as400.resource version of the JobList class in the access package.
