/**
 * Provides classes that assist in setting up forms and tables for HTML pages.
 *
 * <P>
 * These classes provide representations for many common HTML tag elements. Each
 * class produces an HTML tag for a specific element type that can be embedded
 * into any HTML document. The tags that are generated are consistent with the
 * HTML 3.2 specification.
 * </P>
 *
 * <P>
 * The HTML classes work with the com.ibm.as400.util.servlet classes to retrieve
 * data from the IBM i system. They can also be used alone if the user supplies
 * the table or form data.
 * </P>
 *
 * <P>
 * <B>Note:</B> The jt400Servlet.jar file includes both the HTML and Servlet
 * classes. You must update your CLASSPATH to point to the jt400Servlet.jar file
 * if you want to use the classes in the com.ibm.as400.util.html package.
 * </P>
