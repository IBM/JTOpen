Provides classes that graphically present iSeries or AS/400 data to the user.

<P>
These classes use the com.ibm.as400.access classes to retrieve data and
then present that data to the user.
</P>

<P>
The various pane classes are graphical user interface components that
present and allow manipulation of one or more iSeries or AS/400 resources. The behavior
of each resource varies depending on its type.
</P>

<P>
All panes extend the javax.swing.JComponent class. As a result, they can be added to
any AWT or Swing frame, window, or container.
</P>

OS/400 resources are represented in the graphical user interface with an icon
and text. OS/400 resources are defined with hierarchical relationships where a
resoure might have a parent and zero or more children. These are predefined
relationships and are used to specify what resources are displayed in a pane. For example, VJobList is the parent to zero or more VJob objects, and this
hierarchical relationship is represented graphically in a pane.

<P>
Java programs that use the IBM Toolbox for Java GUI (graphical user interface)
classes need Swing 1.1. You get Swing 1.1 by running Java 2 or by downloading
Swing 1.1 from Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the past, IBM Toolbox for Java has
required Swing 1.0.3, and V4R5 is the first release that Swing 1.1 is supported.
To move to Swing 1.1, some programming changes were made; therefore, you may have
to make some programming changes as well. See the <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/index.html">
Java Foundation Classes documentation</A> for more information about Swing.
