Provides classes that graphically present AS/400 data to the user.

<P>
These classes use the com.ibm.as400.access classes to retrieve data and
then present that data to the user.
</P>

<P>
The various AS/400 pane classes are graphical user interface components that
present and allow manipulation of one or more AS/400 resources. The behavior
of each AS/400 resource varies depending on the type of resource.
</P>

<P>
All panes extend the Java Component class. As a result, they can be added to
any AWT Frame, Window, or Container.
</P>

AS/400 resources are represented in the graphical user interface with an icon
and text. AS/400 resources are defined with hierarchical relationships where a
resoure might have a parent and zero or more children. These are predefined
relationships and are used to specify what resources are displayed in an AS/400
pane. For example, VJobList is the parent to zero or more VJob objects, and this
hierarchical relationship is represented graphically in an AS/400 pane.

<P>
Java programs that use the AS/400 Toolbox for Java GUI (graphical user interface)
classes need Swing 1.1. You get Swing 1.1 by running Java 2 or by downloading
Swing 1.1 from Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the past, AS/400 Toolbox for Java has
required Swing 1.0.3, and V4R5 is the first release that Swing 1.1 is supported.
To move to Swing 1.1, some programming changes were made; therefore, you may have
to make some programming changes as well. See the <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/index.html">
Java Foundation Classes documentation</A> for more information about Swing.
