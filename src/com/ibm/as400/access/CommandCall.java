/**
 Represents an IBM i command object.  This class allows the user to call any non-interactive CL command.  
 Results of the command are returned in a message list.
 <P>Note: CommandCall is not designed to return interactive (screen-oriented) results, such as from 
    "WRK..." and "DSP..." commands.  The recommended approach in such cases is to identify an equivalent 
    IBM i API or program, and use {@link ProgramCall ProgramCall} instead.
 <P>The following example demonstrates the use of CommandCall:
 <br>
 <pre>
 *    // Work with commands on system named "Hal."
 *    AS400 system = new AS400("Hal");
 *    CommandCall command = new CommandCall(system);
 *    try
 *    {
 *        // Run the command "CRTLIB FRED."
 *        if (command.run("CRTLIB FRED") != true)
 *        {
 *            // Note that there was an error.
 *            System.out.println("Command failed!");
 *        }
 *        // Show the messages (returned whether or not there was an error.)
 *        AS400Message[] messagelist = command.getMessageList();
 *        for (int i = 0; i &lt; messagelist.length; ++i)
 *        {
 *            // Show each message.
 *            System.out.println(messagelist[i].getText());
 *        }
 *    }
 *    catch (Exception e)
 *    {
 *        System.out.println("Command " + command.getCommand() + " issued an exception!");
 *        e.printStackTrace();
 *    }
 *    // Done with the system.
 *    system.disconnectService(AS400.COMMAND);
 </pre>
 <p>NOTE:  When getting the message list from commands, users no longer have to create a 
    <a href="MessageFile.html">MessageFile</a> to obtain the message help text.  
    The load() method can be used to retrieve additional message information. 
    Then the getHelp() method can be called directly on the <a href="AS400Message.html">AS400Message</a> 
    object returned from getMessageList().  Here is an example:
 <pre>
 *    if (command.run("myCmd") != true)
 *    {
 *        // Show messages.
 *        AS400Message[] messageList = command.getMessageList();
 *        for (int i = 0; i &lt; messageList.length; ++i)
 *        {
 *            // Show each message.
 *            System.out.println(messageList[i].getText());
 *            // Load additional message information.
 *            messageList[i].load();
 *            //Show help text.
 *            System.out.println(messageList[i].getHelp());
 *        }
 *    }
 </pre>
