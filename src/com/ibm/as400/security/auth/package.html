Provides user profile swapping using IBM i profile token and credential classes.

<P>
These classes interact with the security services provided by IBM i. Specifically,
support is provided to authenticate a user identity, sometimes referred to as a
<I>principal</I>, and password against the native IBM i user registry. A credential
representing the authenticated user can then be established. You can use the credential
to alter the identity of the current IBM i thread to perform work under the authorities
and permissions of the authenticated user. In effect, this identity swap results in the
thread acting as if a sign-on was performed by the authenticated user.
</P>

<P>
<B>Note:</B> The services to establish and swap credentials are only supported for
OS/400 release V4R5M0 or greater.
</P>

<P>
The AS400 class in the com.ibm.as400.access package now provides authentication for
a given user profile and password against the IBM i system. You can also retrieve
credentials representing authenticated user profiles and passwords for the system.
These credentials, known as profile tokens, represent an authenticated user profile
and password for a specific system. Profile tokens expire based on time, up to
one hour, but can be refreshed in certain cases to provide an extended life span.
</P>

<P>
<B>Note:</B> While inherently more secure than passing a user profile and password
due to limited life span, profile tokens should still be considered sensitive information
by the application and handled accordingly. Since the token represents an authenticated user
and password, it could potentially be exploited by a hostile application to perform work
on behalf of that user. It is ultimately the responsibility of the application to ensure
that credentials are accessed in a secure manner.
</P>
