<a NAME="About QCDemo"></a><a href="#Table of Contents">About QCDemo</a></h2>
QCDemo demonstrates using the <a href="http://www.as400.ibm.com">AS/400</a>
Java Beans contained in the <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/">JTOpen
projec</a>t to remotely connect to and explore your AS/400 midrange computer.
The name "QC" stands for <i>Quatre Cent</i>, i.e., 400 :-)
<p>QCDemo comes with full source code which is released under an open source
license so that you may modify it to use this source on your own project
if you find it useful or helpful.
<p>QCDemo is a tabbed notebook. Each tabbed page demostrates one or more
JTOpen beans.
<p>The QCDemo tabbed notebook was developed using <a href="http://www.sun.com/forte/ffj/index.html">Sun
Forte for Java</a>. All the .form files which go with the Forte project
are included, but are not necessary to build and/or modify QCDemo for your
use.
<h2>
<a NAME="DISCLAIMER"></a><a href="#Table of Contents">DISCLAIMER</a></h2>
<b><u>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OR WARANTEE FOR THIS
FREE SOFTWARE.</u></b> QCDemo can modify files and settings on any AS/400
to which it is connected. To the best of our belief, it performs exactly
what you direct it to do, which is dangerous enough, isn't it? Other slightly
dangerous aspects of JTOpen itself include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Your logins are real AS400 logins!</li>

<ul>
<li>
Three password failures and OS/400 may lock you out of your account until
QSECOFR deals with it.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<b><u>YOUR LOGINS ARE ENCRYPTED BUT YOUR DATA GO OVER THE NETWORK UNENCRYPTED.</u></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
There is indeed a SecureAS400 component in the JTOpen toolkit, but your
author didn't use it in QCDemo.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

working for IBM and as customers of IBM on so many IBM platforms. And thanks
