The term "JTOpen" refers to the open source software product
"IBM Toolbox for Java" plus any additional enhancements provided by
the open source community. JTOpen, which is supported by IBM and
governed by the IBM Public License, as well as its Java source code,
is contained in the open source repository located off of:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jt400">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jt400</A>.

The terms "Toolbox" and "Toolbox LPP" refer to the IBM Licensed Program Product
"IBM Toolbox for Java" which is supported by IBM and can be obtained from the
IBM Toolbox for Java web site:

<H4>Known deficiencies</H4>
<PRE>
Several Toolbox methods have parameters or return values that are of type Date,
Calendar, or GregorianCalendar. Some of these methods assume that the client
Java application is running in the same time zone as the IBM i server.
This behavior is long-standing, and will be corrected in a future Toolbox release.

<H3><A NAME="65">Fixes and enhancements in JTOpen 6.5</A> <i>(released 2009-05-08)</i></H3>
<PRE>
- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
  The getJob() method is eliminated from classes CommandCall and ProgramCall.
  Applications that reference this method will no longer compile or execute.
  Use method getServerJob() instead.

- BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
  Formerly, when running natively on IBM i, by default the Toolbox looked-up
  the designated thread-safety of CL commands, and called thread-safe CL's
  on-thread to optimize performance.
  Similarly, when running natively on IBM i, by default the Toolbox called
  certain IBM i API's "on-thread" (in the job of the JVM) if the API's were
  known to be thread-safe.
  This introduced problems where successive CL's and programs would be called
  in 2 different jobs (on-thread versus off-thread).
  The new default is to simply call all CL's and programs via the Remote
  Command Host Server.
  To restore the previous CommandCall behavior, set Java system property:
  com.ibm.as400.access.CommandCall.threadSafe=lookup
  To instruct the Toolbox to call all programs on-thread, set the property:
  com.ibm.as400.access.ProgramCall.threadSafe=true
  However, setting threadSafe=true is not advised unless your application
  is known to call only thread-safe programs.
