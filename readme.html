<HR><A NAME="what"><H3>What is the Toolbox?</H3></A>

The IBM Toolbox for Java is a set of Java classes that allow you to
access AS/400 or iSeries data through a Java program. With these classes,
you can write client/server applications, applets, and servlets that work
with data on your server. You can also run Java applications that use the
IBM Toolbox for Java on the OS/400 Java Virtual Machine.

The Toolbox is available as an installable licensed program for the AS/400
as of OS/400 V4R2 and the iSeries as of OS/400 V5R1.
Here is a breakdown of Toolbox releases versus operating
system versions:

JTOpen   Not shipped     NA              NA              V4R3 and up

Newer versions of the Toolbox are backwards-compatible with earlier
versions. Upgrading to a newer version is usually recommended, with the one
main exception being that, starting in Mod 2, the Toolbox does not connect
back to a server running pre-V4R2 OS/400.


<HR><A NAME="why"><H3>Why Open Source?</H3></A>

We are pursuing making the Toolbox code open source for the
following reasons:

1. To obtain new functions and features from the Toolbox user community.

2. To respond with customer and business partners requirements as rapidly
   as possible.

3. To improve the ability for our customers to build and debug their own
   applications when using the Toolbox functions.

4. To continue the drive to keep the iSeries a leader with Java technology
   for application development.


<HR><A NAME="diff"><H3>Differences between JTOpen and the Toolbox LPP</H3></A>

1. The initial release of the source code for JTOpen uses the Mod 3
   Toolbox codebase. That is, the Java code in the open source repository
   is the same code that is used to build the Mod 3 Toolbox LPP. JTOpen 2.0x
   uses the Mod 4 Toolbox as its codebase. The latest release of JTOpen
   (JTOpen 3.0x) uses the Mod 5 Toolbox as its codebase.

2. When bugs are reported, fixes will be committed to JTOpen as soon as
   they are realized. When applicable, these same fixes will be committed
   to the Toolbox LPP and made available in a future PTF or service pack.

3. Any new functionality that is committed to JTOpen will not be
   automatically added into the Toolbox LPP. However, new function that
   exists in future releases of the Toolbox LPP may also get submitted
   to the JTOpen repository, at IBM's discretion. The end result is
   JTOpen will become a superset of the Toolbox LPP.

   Note: All changes to JTOpen are made under the control and at the
   discretion of the JTOpen Core Team. All changes to the Toolbox LPP
   are made under the control and at the discretion of IBM.

4. Initially, JTOpen only contained most of the classes from the
   com.ibm.as400.access package. As of release 2.0x, it contains almost
   all of the primary Toolbox packages:
     com.ibm.as400.access
     com.ibm.as400.data
     com.ibm.as400.resource
     com.ibm.as400.util.html
     com.ibm.as400.util.servlet
     com.ibm.as400.vaccess
     utilities
     
   As time permits, more code and packages from the Toolbox will be added
   to this repository.

5. In general, the Toolbox LPP is supported directly by IBM. JTOpen
   is supported by the JTOpen user community, of which IBM participates
   and contributes, specifically through developer email, the JTOpen
   mailing list, and the JTOpen web forum located at:
     http://as400service.ibm.com/j_dir/JTOpen.nsf/By+Date?OpenView

6. Pursuant to the IBM Public License, programmers are free to alter the
   JTOpen source code and to distribute it with their own applications.


<HR><A NAME="down"><H3>Download and installation of JTOpen</H3></A>

<A NAME="req"><H4><U>Requirements</U></H4></A>
Briefly, the requirements for using the JTOpen code are as follows:

1. A Sun-compliant Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with a 1.1.x or higher JDK/JRE.

2. Almost all JTOpen functions require a TCP/IP connection to an iSeries or
   AS/400 server.

   a. The server must be OS/400 V4R2 or higher.

   b. The server must have the Option 12 Host Servers installed and
      running. JTOpen uses the host servers as TCP/IP endpoints to
      communicate with the server from a client.

   c. If the Java application using JTOpen is being run directly on a server
      running OS/400, then certain JTOpen functions will use native API and/or
      socket calls for performance. This is only the case if:
        (1) the Java application is being run under the same user profile that
            is provided to the JTOpen connection object; and,
        (2) the release level of the JTOpen/Toolbox product matches the
            release of OS/400 - for JTOpen 2.0x, the level of OS/400 must be
            V5R1.
      
      If these two requirements are not met, it will not be possible for the
      JTOpen/Toolbox code to take advantage of native optimizations; instead, 
      socket calls will be made to the host servers.

3. For GUI programming, either Java 2 or Swing 1.1 or higher is required.

<A NAME="files"><H4><U>Files</U></H4></A>
JTOpen is comprised of the following files:

Jar file          Contents
--------          --------
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/jtStubs.jar">jtStubs.jar</A>       Contains extra classes possibly needed to compile the
                  JTOpen source.
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/src.zip">src.zip</A>           This is a zip file of all the source files in the
                  repository. It is not a Java jar file.
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/doc.zip">doc.zip</A>           This is a zip file of the javadoc (in HTML format)
                  for the JTOpen source files. It is not a Java jar file.
jt400.jar         This is the open source version of the LPP jt400.jar. It
                  contains almost all open source code (except for the few
                  Toolbox classes that could not be open-sourced). As more
                  Toolbox code is submitted as open source, it replaces
                  the LPP code in this jar file.
jt400Micro.jar    This contains the ToolboxME (Micro Edition) classes for
                  use on a handheld device.
jt400Native.jar   The open source version of the LPP jt400Native.jar or
                  jt400Access.zip. This jar does not contain the vaccess
                  package. It does contain the native optimization classes
                  necessary for running performance-enhanced applications
                  on the OS/400 JVM.
jt400Proxy.jar    The open source version of the LPP jt400Proxy.jar. This
                  jar contains just the classes needed to run a client
                  application using the Toolbox proxy server. It is
                  especially useful in environments where a smaller jar
                  is needed.
jt400Servlet.jar  The open source version of the LPP jt400Servlet.jar.
                  This jar contains the html and servlet packages.
                  
The first three files are available through the JTOpen web site
located at <A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400">http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400</A>. But
due to export regulations, the other jar files can only be downloaded from
the official Toolbox web site downloads page:
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox/downloads.htm">http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox/downloads.htm</A>.

There are other jar files shipped in the download for JTOpen off of the Toolbox
downloads page. Those jar files do not (yet) contain JTOpen code. They are
provided as a convenience to the developer and to mirror the objects that ship
with the Toolbox LPP.

As of JTOpen 3.3, MD5 checksums are provided to verify download integrity.

<A NAME="use"><H4><U>Building and Using JTOpen</U></H4></A>
Instructions for using JTOpen:
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Add it to your CLASSPATH.
3. Run your application.

Instructions for building all or part of the JTOpen source code:
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Download any source files you want to change. The src.zip file includes
   all of the source in the repository for convenience.
3. Download jtStubs.jar. This is needed ONLY at compile time, if at all.
4. Set up your CLASSPATH to include everything in the correct order:
   a. Your source files should be in your CLASSPATH first. Note that you
      cannot point to src.zip - you must unzip it, since it contains only
      source files.
   b. Next, add jt400.jar.
   c. Finally, add jtStubs.jar.
   d. It should look something like this:
      CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MyApp;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;C:\jt400\jtStubs.jar;...
5. Compile your source.
6. Remove jtStubs.jar from your CLASSPATH. If you don't, certain pieces of
   code may not function correctly, namely JDBC and applets. It should now
   look like this:
     CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MySource;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;...
7. Run your application.

<A NAME="toolbox"><H4><U>Using the Toolbox LPP</U></H4></A>
For those interested in the Toolbox LPP version of this software:

The Mod 5 Toolbox LPP ships the following files, which are available
for download off of the official Toolbox web site at
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox">http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox</A>.

Jar file           Contents
--------           --------
jt400.jar          Contains the access, data (PCML), resource, vaccess,
                   and security packages.
jt400Access.zip    Contains the access, data, resource, security, HTML, and servlet
                   packages, along with Toolbox native optimization classes used
                   when running directly on the OS/400 JVM.
jt400Proxy.jar     Contains proxy classes for the access package. Useful for
                   applets or environments where a small jar file is needed. A middle
                   tier machine running the Toolbox ProxyServer is required to forward
                   proxy client requests to the backend server.
jt400Servlet.jar   Contains the HTML and servlet packages.
utilities package  Contains various helper applications for the Toolbox,
                   such as JarMaker and AS400ToolboxInstaller.
data400.jar        Contains the PCML runtime package as provided by
                   Operations Navigator.
jui400.jar         Contains the PDML runtime packages as provided by
                   the Graphical Toolbox.
uitools.jar        Contains the GUI Builder packages as provided by the
                   Graphical Toolbox.
util400.jar        Contains various utilities.
x4j400.jar         Contains the IBM XML Parser for Java.
composer.jar       Contains XSL stylesheet composer classes.
reportwriter.jar   Contains XSL report processor classes.

Instructions for using the Toolbox LPP:
1. Download the Toolbox and extract the jar file(s) you wish to use. This
   will be jt400.jar in most cases.
2. Add it to your CLASSPATH.
3. Run your application.
