The term "JTOpen" refers to the open source software product "IBM Toolbox for Java"
plus any additional Enhancements provided by the open source community.
JTOpen, which is governed by the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ibmpl.php">IBM Public License</A>, as well as its Java source code,
is contained in the open source repository located off of:

The terms "Toolbox" and "Toolbox LPP" refer to the IBM Licensed Program Product
"IBM Toolbox for Java", which is supported by IBM and can be obtained from the
IBM Toolbox for Java web site:

<HR><A NAME="what"><H3>What is the Toolbox?</H3></A>

The IBM Toolbox for Java is a set of Java classes that allow you to
access IBM i, i5/OS, or OS/400 data through a Java program. With these classes,
you can write client/server applications, applets, and servlets that work
with data on your IBM i, i5/OS, or OS/400 system. You can also run Java
applications that use the IBM Toolbox for Java on the IBM i, i5/OS, or
OS/400 Java Virtual Machine.

The Toolbox is available as an installable licensed program for 
IBM i.  Here is a breakdown of the supported
Toolbox releases versus operating system versions:

Toolbox                         Installs on     Connects to
release         LPP release     OS/400 version  OS/400 version
-------         --------------  --------------  --------------
JTOpen 9.0+     5770SS1 V7R3M0  V7R1 and up     V7R1 and up
JTOpen 10.0+    5770SS1 V7R4M0  V7R2 and up     V7R2 and up
JTOpen 11.0+    5770SS1 V7R5M0  V7R3 and up     V7R3 and up
JTOpen 20.0+    5770SS1 V7R5M0  V7R3 and up     V7R3 and up
JTOpen 21.0+    5770SS1 V7R6M0  V7R3 and up     V7R3 and up

Newer versions of the Toolbox are backwards-compatible with earlier
versions. Upgrading to a newer version is usually recommended, with the one
main exception being that the Toolbox is only supported for connection
to servers running an in-service release of i5/OS or OS/400.


<HR><A NAME="why"><H3>Why Open Source?</H3></A>

We have chosen to make the Toolbox code open source for the following reasons:

1. To obtain new functions and features from the Toolbox user community.

2. To respond with customer and business partners requirements as rapidly
   as possible.

3. To improve the ability for our customers to build and debug their own
   applications when using the Toolbox functions.

4. To continue the drive to keep the IBM i platform a leader with Java technology
   for application development.

<HR><A NAME="diff"><H3>Differences between JTOpen and the Toolbox LPP</H3></A>

1. The initial release of the source code for JTOpen used the V4R5
   Toolbox codebase. That is, the Java code in the open source repository
   is the same code that was used to build the V4R5 Toolbox LPP. 

2. When bugs are reported, fixes will be committed to JTOpen as soon as
   they are realized. When applicable, these same fixes will made available 
   in a future PTF.

3. Any new functionality that is committed to JTOpen will be subsequently
   added, when applicable, and made available in a future PTF.

   Note: All changes to JTOpen are made under the control and at the
   discretion of the JTOpen Core Team. All changes to the Toolbox LPP
   are made under the control and at the discretion of IBM.

4. In general, the Toolbox LPP is supported directly by IBM. JTOpen
   is supported by the JTOpen user community, in which IBM participates
   and contributes, specifically through developer email, the JTOpen
   mailing list, and <A HREF="https://github.com/IBM/JTOpen/issues">JTOpen github issues</A>

5. Pursuant to the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ibmpl.php">IBM Public License</A>, programmers are free to alter the
   JTOpen source code and to distribute it with their own applications.

<HR><A NAME="down"><H3>Download and installation of JTOpen</H3></A>

<A NAME="req"><H4><U>Requirements</U></H4></A>
Briefly, the requirements for using the JTOpen code are as follows:

1. A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with a 1.8.x or higher JDK/JRE. The JTOpen
   team highly recommends moving to the latest supported release of the JDK/JRE, as
   maintaining backwards-compatible code with older releases becomes
   increasingly difficult to support over time.

2. Almost all JTOpen functions require a TCP/IP connection to an IBM i server.

   a. The server must be IBM i V7R3 or higher.

   b. The server must have the Option 12 Host Servers installed and
      running. JTOpen uses the host servers as TCP/IP endpoints to
      communicate with the server from a client.

   c. If the Java application using JTOpen is being run directly on a server
      running IBM i, then certain JTOpen functions might use
      native API and/or local socket calls to improve performance.
      This will only occur under certain conditions, and only if the file
      jt400Native.jar is included in the application's CLASSPATH.


<A NAME="files"><H4><U>Files</U></H4></A>
JTOpen is comprised of the following files:
<pre>
Jar file                Contents
--------                --------

jt400-_._._-sources.jar This is a zip file of all the source files in the repository.
                        It is not a Java jar file.

jt400-_._._-javadoc.jar This is a zip file of the javadoc (in HTML format) for
                        the JTOpen source files. It is not a Java jar file.

jt400-_._._.jar         This is the main JTOpen jar file. It contains almost all open
                        source code (except for the few Toolbox classes that could
                        not be open-sourced), including the utilities package,
                        and the JDBC driver.  It is compiled for Java 8. 
                        
jt400-_._._-java11.jar  This is the main JTOpen jar file compiled for Java 11. 
                        A Java 11 JVM is required to use this class.                   

jt400-_._._-native.jar  Jar file containing the native optimization classes necessary 
                        for running performance-enhanced applications on IBM i JVM.   

jt400-_._._-native.jar  This is the native jar file cmpiled for Java 11.
