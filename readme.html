<HR><A NAME="what"><H3>What is the Toolbox?</H3></A>

The IBM Toolbox for Java is a set of Java classes that allow you to
access i5/OS or OS/400 data through a Java program. With these classes,
you can write client/server applications, applets, and servlets that work
with data on your i5/OS or OS/400 system. You can also run Java applications that use the
IBM Toolbox for Java on the i5/OS or OS/400 Java Virtual Machine.

The Toolbox is available as an installable licensed program for the AS/400
as of OS/400 V4R2 and the iSeries as of OS/400 V5R1. Here is a breakdown of
Toolbox releases versus operating system versions:

JTOpen 6.1+     5761JC1 V6R1M0  V5R3 and up     V5R3 and up

(*) Note: Toolbox release V5R3 is equivalent to JTOpen 4.3.
(**) Note:  Toolbox release V5R4 is equivalent to JTOpen 4.8.


Newer versions of the Toolbox are backwards-compatible with earlier
versions. Upgrading to a newer version is usually recommended, with the one
main exception being that the Toolbox is only supported 
for connection to servers running either of the two prior releases of i5/OS or OS/400.


<HR><A NAME="why"><H3>Why Open Source?</H3></A>

We have chosen to make the Toolbox code open source for the
following reasons:

1. To obtain new functions and features from the Toolbox user community.

2. To respond with customer and business partners requirements as rapidly
   as possible.

3. To improve the ability for our customers to build and debug their own
   applications when using the Toolbox functions.

4. To continue the drive to keep the iSeries a leader with Java technology
   for application development.


<HR><A NAME="diff"><H3>Differences between JTOpen and the Toolbox LPP</H3></A>

1. The initial release of the source code for JTOpen used the V4R5
   Toolbox codebase. That is, the Java code in the open source repository
   is the same code that was used to build the V4R5 Toolbox LPP. JTOpen 2.0x
   uses the V5R1 Toolbox as its codebase. The latest release of JTOpen
   (JTOpen 6.x) uses the V6R1 Toolbox as its codebase.

2. When bugs are reported, fixes will be committed to JTOpen as soon as
   they are realized. When applicable, these same fixes will be committed
   to the Toolbox LPP and made available in a future PTF or service pack.

3. Any new functionality that is committed to JTOpen will not be
   automatically added into the Toolbox LPP. However, new function that
   exists in future releases of the Toolbox LPP may also get submitted
   to the JTOpen repository, at IBM's discretion. The end result is
   JTOpen will become a superset of the Toolbox LPP.

   Note: All changes to JTOpen are made under the control and at the
   discretion of the JTOpen Core Team. All changes to the Toolbox LPP
   are made under the control and at the discretion of IBM.

<!--
4. Initially, JTOpen only contained most of the classes from the
   com.ibm.as400.access package. As of release 2.0x, it contains almost
   all of the primary Toolbox packages:
     com.ibm.as400.access
     com.ibm.as400.data
     com.ibm.as400.resource
     com.ibm.as400.util.html
     com.ibm.as400.util.servlet
     com.ibm.as400.vaccess
     utilities
     
   As time permits, more code and packages from the Toolbox will be added
   to this repository.
-->
4. In general, the Toolbox LPP is supported directly by IBM. JTOpen
   is supported by the JTOpen user community, in which IBM participates
   and contributes, specifically through developer email, the JTOpen
   mailing list, and the JTOpen web forum located at:
     http://www-912.ibm.com/j_dir/JTOpen.nsf/By+Date?OpenView

5. Pursuant to the IBM Public License, programmers are free to alter the
   JTOpen source code and to distribute it with their own applications.


<HR><A NAME="down"><H3>Download and installation of JTOpen</H3></A>

<A NAME="req"><H4><U>Requirements</U></H4></A>
Briefly, the requirements for using the JTOpen code are as follows:

1. A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with a 1.2.x or higher JDK/JRE. The JTOpen
   team highly recommends moving to the latest supported release of the JDK/JRE, as
   maintaining backwards-compatible code with older releases becomes
   increasingly difficult to support over time.

2. Almost all JTOpen functions require a TCP/IP connection to an iSeries or
   AS/400 server.

   a. The server must be i5/OS, or OS/400 V4R3 or higher.

   b. The server must have the Option 12 Host Servers installed and
      running. JTOpen uses the host servers as TCP/IP endpoints to
      communicate with the server from a client.

   c. If the Java application using JTOpen is being run directly on a server
      running i5/OS or OS/400, then certain JTOpen functions might use native API and/or
      local socket calls to improve performance. This will only occur under
      certain conditions, and only if the jt400Native.jar is included in
      the application's CLASSPATH.

3. For GUI programming, either Java 2 or Swing 1.1 or higher is required.

<A NAME="files"><H4><U>Files</U></H4></A>
JTOpen is comprised of the following files:

Jar file          Contents
--------          --------

<!--
jtStubs.jar       As of JTOpen 4.0 and JDK 1.4, this jar file is no longer required.
-->
jtopen_x_x_source.zip  This is a zip file of all the source files in the repository.
                       It is not a Java jar file.

jtopen_x_x_javadoc.zip This is a zip file of the javadoc (in HTML format) for
                       the JTOpen source files. It is not a Java jar file.

jt400.jar(*)         This is the main JTOpen jar file. It contains almost all open
                     source code (except for the few Toolbox classes that could
                     not be open-sourced), including the utilities package,
                     and the JDBC driver (JDBC 3.0).

jt400Micro.jar(*)    This contains the ToolboxME (Micro Edition) classes for
                     use on a handheld device.

jt400Native.jar(*)   Previously known as jt400Access.zip, this jar does not
                     contain the vaccess package. It does contain the native
                     optimization classes necessary for running performance-enhanced
                     applications on the i5/OS or OS/400 JVM.

jt400Proxy.jar(*)    This jar contains just the classes needed to run a client
                     application using the Toolbox proxy server. It is
                     especially useful in environments where a smaller jar
                     is needed.

jt400Servlet.jar(*)  This jar contains the html and servlet packages.

jui400.jar(*)        Contains the PDML runtime packages as provided by
                     the Graphical Toolbox.

uitools.jar(*)       Contains the GUI Builder packages as provided by the
                     Graphical Toolbox.

util400.jar(*)       Contains various utilities.

composer.jar(*)      Contains XSL stylesheet composer classes.

reportwriter.jar(*)  Contains XSL report processor classes.

outputwriters.jar(*) Contains PDF, PCL, and font classes.

tes.jar(*)           Contains the iSeries Graphical Debugger.

jtopen_x_x_jdbc40.zip  This zip file contains versions of jt400.jar and
                       jt400Native.jar (along with source code) that are
                       compatible for use with JDBC 4.0, on Java 6.0 or higher.


(*) Files contained in file jtopen_x_x.zip.

<!--
The first three files are available through the JTOpen web site
located at <A HREF="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/">http://jt400.sourceforge.net/</A>.
Due to export regulations, the other jar files can only be downloaded from
the official Toolbox web site downloads page:
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox/downloads.htm">http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox/downloads.htm</A>.
-->
There are other jar files shipped in the download for JTOpen off of the Toolbox
downloads page. Those jar files do not (yet) contain JTOpen code. They are
provided as a convenience to the developer and to mirror the objects that ship
with the Toolbox LPP.

<A NAME="use"><H4><U>Building and Using JTOpen</U></H4></A>
Instructions for using JTOpen:
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Add it to your CLASSPATH.
3. Run your application.

Instructions for building all or part of the JTOpen source code:
<i>Note: Complete build instructions are specified in the commentary in file /build/build.xml</i>
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Download any source files you want to change. The src.zip file includes
   all of the source in the repository for convenience.
3. Download jtStubs.jar. This is needed ONLY at compile time, if at all.
4. Set up your CLASSPATH to include everything in the correct order:
   a. Your source files should be in your CLASSPATH first. Note that you
      cannot point to src.zip - you must unzip it, since it contains only
      source files.
   b. Next, add jt400.jar.
   c. Finally, add jtStubs.jar.
   d. It should look something like this:
      CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MyApp;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;C:\jt400\jtStubs.jar;...
5. Compile your source.
6. Remove jtStubs.jar from your CLASSPATH. If you don't, certain pieces of
   code may not function correctly, namely JDBC and applets. It should now
   look like this:
     CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MySource;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;...
7. Run your application.
<!--
<A NAME="toolbox"><H4><U>Using the Toolbox LPP</U></H4></A>
For those interested in the Toolbox LPP version of this software:

The V6R1 Toolbox LPP ships the following files, which are available
for download off of the official Toolbox web site at
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox">http://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/iseries/toolbox</A>.
