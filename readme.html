<HR><A NAME="what"><H3>What is the Toolbox?</H3></A>

The AS/400 Toolbox for Java is a set of Java classes that allow you to
access AS/400 data through a Java program. With these classes, you can
write client/server applications, applets, and servlets that work with
data on your AS/400. You can also run Java applications that use the AS/400
Toolbox for Java on the AS/400's Java virtual machine.

The Toolbox is available as an installable licensed program for the AS/400
as of V4R2. Here is a breakdown of Toolbox releases versus operating
system versions:

Toolbox  Shipped with                    Installs on     Connects to
release  OS/400 version  LPP release     OS/400 version  OS/400 version

Mod 1    V4R3            5763JC1 V3R2M1  V3R2 and up     V3R2 and up

Mod 3    V4R5            5769JC1 V4R5M0  V4R3 and up     V4R2 and up
JTOpen   Not shipped     NA              NA              V4R2 and up

Newer versions of the Toolbox are backwards-compatible with earlier
versions. Upgrading to a newer version is usually recommended, with the one
main exception being that, starting in Mod 2, the Toolbox does not connect
back to a pre-V4R2 AS/400.


<HR><A NAME="why"><H3>Why Open Source?</H3></A>

We are pursuing making the Toolbox code open source for the
following reasons:

1. To obtain new functions and features from the Toolbox user community.

2. To respond with customer and business partners requirements as rapidly
   as possible.

3. To improve the ability for our customers to build and debug their own
   applications when using the Toolbox functions.

4. To continue the drive to keep AS/400 a leader with Java technology for
   application development.


<HR><A NAME="diff"><H3>Differences between JTOpen and the Toolbox LPP</H3></A>

1. The initial release of the source code for JTOpen uses the Mod 3
   Toolbox codebase. That is, the Java code in the open source repository
   is the same code that is used to build the Mod 3 Toolbox LPP.

2. When bugs are reported, fixes will be committed to JTOpen as soon as
   they are realized. When applicable, these same fixes will be committed
   to the Toolbox LPP and made available in a future PTF or service pack.

3. Any new functionality that is committed to JTOpen will not be
   automatically added into the Toolbox LPP. However, new function that
   exists in future releases of the Toolbox LPP may also get submitted
   to the JTOpen repository, at IBM's discretion. The end result is
   JTOpen will become a superset of the Toolbox LPP.

   Note: All changes to JTOpen are made under the control and at the
   discretion of the JTOpen Core Team. All changes to the Toolbox LPP
   are made under the control and at the discretion of IBM.

4. Initially, the JTOpen only contains most of the classes from the
   com.ibm.as400.access package. As time permits, more code and packages
   from the Mod 3 Toolbox will be released into this repository.

5. In general, the Toolbox LPP is supported directly by IBM. JTOpen
   is supported by the JTOpen user community, of which IBM participates
   and contributes.

6. Pursuant to the IBM Public License, programmers are free to alter the
   JTOpen source code and to distribute it with their own applications.


<HR><A NAME="down"><H3>Download and installation of JTOpen</H3></A>

<A NAME="req"><H4><U>Requirements</U></H4></A>
Briefly, the requirements for using the JTOpen code are as follows:

1. A Sun-compliant Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with a 1.1.x or higher JDK/JRE.

2. Almost all JTOpen functions require a TCP/IP connection to an AS/400.

   a. The AS/400 must be V4R2 or higher.

   b. The AS/400 must have the Option 12 Host Servers installed and
      running. JTOpen uses the host servers to communicate with the
      AS/400 from a client.

   c. If the Java application using JTOpen is being run directly on an
      AS/400, then certain JTOpen functions will use native API and/or
      socket calls for performance. This is only the case if the Java
      application is being run under the same user profile that is provided
      to the JTOpen connection object; otherwise, the host servers are used.

3. For GUI programming, either Java 2 or Swing 1.1 or higher is required.

<A NAME="files"><H4><U>Files</U></H4></A>
JTOpen is comprised of the following files:

Jar file          Contents
--------          --------
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/jtStubs.jar">jtStubs.jar</A>       Contains the classes needed to compile the JTOpen source.
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/src.zip">src.zip</A>           This is a zip file of all the source files in the
                  repository. It is not a Java jar file.
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400/doc.zip">doc.zip</A>           This is a zip file of the javadoc (in HTML format)
                  for the JTOpen source files. It is not a Java jar file.
jt400.jar         This is the open source version of the LPP jt400.jar. It
                  contains the open source access package instead of the LPP
                  access package. As more Toolbox code is submitted as open
                  source, it replaces the LPP code in this jar file.

The first two files are available through the IBM developerWorks web site
located at <A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400">http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jt400</A>. But
due to export regulations, the jt400.jar file can only be downloaded from
the official Toolbox web site located at <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/as400/toolbox">http://www.ibm.com/as400/toolbox</A>.

<A NAME="use"><H4><U>Building and Using JTOpen</U></H4></A>
Instructions for using JTOpen:
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Add it to your CLASSPATH.
3. Run your application.

Instructions for building all or part of the JTOpen source code:
1. Download the JTOpen jt400.jar.
2. Download any source files you want to change. The src.zip file includes
   all of the source in the repository for convenience.
3. Download jtStubs.jar. This is needed ONLY at compile time.
4. Set up your CLASSPATH to include everything in the correct order:
   a. Your source files should be in your CLASSPATH first. Note that you
      cannot point to src.zip - you must unzip it, since it contains only
      source files.
   b. Next, add jt400.jar.
   c. Finally, add jtStubs.jar.
   d. It should look something like this:
      CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MyApp;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;C:\jt400\jtStubs.jar;...
5. Compile your source.
6. Remove jtStubs.jar from your CLASSPATH. If you don't, certain pieces of
   code may not function correctly, namely JDBC and applets. It should now
   look like this:
     CLASSPATH=C:\jt400\MySource;C:\jt400\jt400.jar;...
7. Run your application.

<A NAME="toolbox"><H4><U>Using the Toolbox LPP</U></H4></A>
